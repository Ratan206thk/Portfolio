                he understood my vision and brought it into life exactly the way I was expecting. Starting from the
                wireframe, designing the logo, placing every page, creating the prototype he helped me with every aspect
                of it and also provided me important suggestions to incorporate into my initial plan. I have received my
                final prototype in just 10days with all the change requests during the design. <br><br>
                He is extremely talented and a good human being, I would highly recommend him and if I get a chance I
                would definitely work with him in the future."</p>

At Revidya, we went through at least 10 diff product iterations and 3 diff company formats - all of which Chintan was able to glide through and ace beautifully. Every good freelancer also needs great interpersonal and team work skills another area where Chintan showed exemplary teamwork abilities.
